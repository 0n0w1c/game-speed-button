#### A button to change game speeds

Need to leave but the game won't hurry up... click the button!  
Running a long distance but takes too long... click the button!  
Handcrafting taking forever... click the button!  

A no cheating speed-up/slow-down, entire game runs at the selected speed.  

Caution: It is a little addicting to use.  

Note: To work properly, if you adjust the game speeds in the startup settings, the speeds must be separated by a space and in ascending order.  
The minimum speed is 0.01 and the maximum is 60, values outside of this range are ignored. A blank list of speeds is valid.  
While 60 is the coded maximum speed, the actual maximum speed may be limited by how fast your computer can run your factory.
