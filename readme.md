#### A button to change game speeds

Need to leave but the game won't hurry up... click the button!  
Running a long distance but takes too long... click the button!  
Handcrafting taking forever... click the button!  

A no cheating speed-up/slow-down, entire game runs at the selected speed.  

Caution: It is a little addicting to use.
